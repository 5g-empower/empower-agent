.SH NAME
click-xform \- pattern-based Click router configuration optimizer
'
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B click-xform
.I \%[options]
.I \%[router\-file]
.I \%[pattern\-files]
'
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B click-xform
tool is a Click router configuration optimizer. It reads files giving Click
configuration patterns and their replacements, and a router configuration
file. Then it replaces patterns in the configuration until none remain and
writes the new configuration to the standard output.
.PP
Each pattern file uses the Click language (see
.M click 5 ).
It should contain pairs of `elementclass' definitions, where one of each
pair is a pattern and the other is a replacement. The replacement for a
pattern named
.RI ` pattern '
must be named
.RI ` pattern _Replacement'.
This example pattern file replaces all Queues with Queue-Shaper
combinations:
.Rs
.nf
elementclass QueuePattern {
  input -> Queue -> output;
}
elementclass QueuePattern_Replacement {
  input -> Queue -> Shaper(200) -> output;
}
.fi
.Re
.PP
A pattern can contain an arbitrary number of elements, and an arbitrary
number of input and output ports. Basically, a pattern matches a
configuration subset when all its component elements match; all its
connections are duplicated in the configuration subset; and any connections
into or out of the configuration subset correspond to connections to or
from the pattern's input and output ports. The formal definition of
matching is given below.
.PP
Any configuration strings in the pattern must match the configuration
strings in the configuration subset. The pattern can use variables, which
look like `$[letters, numbers and underscores]', to match a set of
configuration strings; except for variables, the strings must match
verbatim. A variable matches a single configuration argument. The same
variable can be used multiple times in a pattern; if so, then it must match
the same text on each occurrence. If a variable is used in the
replacement's configuration strings, then when a replacement is made, the
text that matched in the pattern will be inserted instead. For example,
applying this pattern
.Rs
.nf
elementclass Meters {
  input -> Meter($r1)
        -> Shaper($r2) -> output;
}
elementclass Meters_Replacement {
  input -> PacketMeter($r2)
        -> PacketShaper($r1) -> output;
}
.fi
.Re
to this configuration
.Rs
.nf
\&... -> Meter(1000) -> Shaper(2000) -> ...
.fi
.Re
will create this result:
.Rs
.nf
\&... -> PacketMeter(2000) -> PacketShaper(1000) -> ...
.fi
.Re
.PP
The optimizer will not apply the same pattern to a configuration subset
twice in succession. Specifically, every replacement element is marked with
the pattern that it came from; a pattern will not match a configuration
subset if every element in that subset came from that pattern. Thus, a
pattern like the QueuePattern above won't cause an infinite loop. You can
still cause an infinite loop, if you'd like, by having two patterns that
match the same text:
.Rs
.nf
elementclass Evil1 {
  input -> Queue -> output;
}
elementclass Evil1_Replacement {
  input -> Queue -> output;
}
elementclass Evil2 {
  input -> Queue -> output;
}
elementclass Evil2_Replacement {
  input -> Queue -> output;
}
.fi
.Re
This collection of patterns will make the optimizer run forever on any
configuration that has a Queue.

.SH "FORMAL DEFINITION OF MATCHING"
'
A pattern
.I P
matches a subset
.I S
of the configuration's elements if the following conditions hold:
.TP 4
\(bu
There is a one-to-one mapping 
.I map
from
.I P
to
.I S
that respects element classes (that is, if an element
.IR p " in " P
has class
.IR K ,
then
.RI map( p ") also has class " K ).
.TP 4
\(bu
The configuration strings match, possibly by using a consistent variable
assignment.
.TP 4
\(bu
For every connection
.RI ` p1 " [" x "] -> [" y "] " p2 '
in the pattern
.IR P ,
there exists a connection
.RI `map( p1 ") [" x "] -> [" y "] map(" p2 )'
in the configuration subset
.IR S .
.TP 4
\(bu
For every connection
.RI ` c1 " [" x "] -> [" y "] " c2 '
in the configuration, one of four conditions hold:
.RS
.TP 3
\(bu
The connection is wholly outside the subset
.IR S .
(That is,
.IR c1 " is not in " S
and
.IR c2 " is not in " S .)
.TP 3
\(bu
The connection is inside the subset, and corresponds to a connection in the
pattern. (That is,
.IR c1 " is in " S ,
.IR c2 " is in " S ,
and
.I P
has a connection
.RI "`map-1(" c1 ") [" x "] -> [" y "] map-1(" c2 ")'.)"
.TP 3
\(bu
The connection goes into the subset, and corresponds to an input port in
the pattern. (That is,
.IR c1 " is not in " S
but
.IR c2 " is in " S ,
and there exists an input port number
.I i
so that
.I P
has a connection
.RI "`input [" i "] -> [" y "] map-1(" c2 ")',"
and for every connection in the pattern
.RI "`input [" i "] -> [" z "] " q ',
there is a connection in the configuration
.RI ` c1 " [" x "] -> [" z "] map(" q ")'.)"
.TP 3
\(bu
The connection goes out of the subset, and corresponds to an output port in
the pattern. (That is,
.IR c1 " is in " S
but
.IR c2 " is not in " S ,
and there exists an output port number
.I o
so that
.I P
has a connection
.RI "`map-1(" c1 ") [" x "] -> [" o "] output',"
and for every connection in the pattern
.RI ` q " [" z "] -> [" o "] output',"
there is a connection in the configuration
.RI "`map(" q ") [" z "] -> [" y "] " c2 "'.)"
