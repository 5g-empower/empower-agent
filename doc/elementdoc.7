.TH ELEMENTDOC 7 "\*D" "Version \*V"
.SH NAME
elementdoc \- Click documentation for elements
'
.SH DESCRIPTION
Documentation for a Click element is automatically generated from formatted
comments in its header files. This manual page describes how to write one
of these formatted comments.
.PP
Click element documentation syntax is based on Perl-style PODs; see
.M perlpod 1
for more information. However, not all POD constructs are usable in element
documentation at the moment; and Click element documentation is
line-oriented, not paragraph-oriented.

.SH "COMMENT SYNTAX"
Each piece of documentation is stored in a single block comment
`\f(CW/*...*/\fR'. Two kinds of block comment are recognized:
.PP
.nf
    /*
    =c
    ElementName(...)
    ... and so on ...
    */

    /*
     * =c
     * ElementName(...)
     * ... and so on ...
     */
.fi
.PP
In the first form, commands and normal text MUST begin in the first column
of each line. In the second form, commands and normal text MUST begin in
the fourth column of each line, immediately following the initial star and
spaces `\f(CW\ *\ \fR'. Indented lines are treated as verbatim text, as in
POD.
'
.SH "COMMANDS"
Commands are lines that begin with `\f(CW=\fR' and a lower-case letter.
There are two kinds of commands, those that start new sections and those
that occur within sections. There is also a set of formatting
commands\*Efor turning text bold, for example\*Ethat occurs inside normal
text; they are described in the next section.
'
.SS "Section Commands"
.TP 5
\f(CW=c\fR
Begin the synopsis section. This section is mandatory.
.RS 5
.PP
The \f(CW=c\fR section gives the element's name and any of its
configuration arguments. For example:
.nf
   =c
   IPEncap(PROTOCOL, SADDR, DADDR)
.fi
.PP
Configuration arguments should be specified as all-upper-case words. The
description section will use those upper-case words to talk about the
arguments. Use brackets to show that an argument is optional:
.nf
   =c
   UDPIPEncap(SADDR, SPORT, DADDR, DPORT [, CHECKSUM?])
.fi
.PP
Do not use anything more complicated than brackets. If an element has
complex syntax, either use upper-case words and talk about the syntax more
in the description section, or give multiple lines:
.nf
   =c
   ControlSocket(tcp, PORTNUMBER [, READONLY?])
   ControlSocket(unix, PORTNUMBER [, READONLY?])
.fi
(`tcp' and `unix' are lowercase because they should be typed verbatim.)
.RE
'
.TP 5
\f(CW=io\fR
Begin the inputs and outputs section. This section mentions how many inputs
and outputs the element has. It is usually quite short; for example:
.nf
   =io
   None
.fi
This section is optional, and most elements don't bother to have one; they
mention inputs and outputs in the description section.
'
.TP 5
\f(CW=processing\fR
Begin the processing type section. This section mentions the processing
types of the element's input and output ports. It is usually quite short; for
example:
.nf
   =processing
   Push inputs, pull outputs
.fi
This section is optional. Documentation processing tools will generate a
\f(CW=processing\fR section from the element's \fBprocessing\fP() method,
if possible.
'
.TP 5
\f(CW=d\fR
Begin the description section.
.RS 5
.PP
This section tells how the element should be used. It is usually the
longest section. When mentioning configuration arguments, use the
upper-case words given in the \f(CW=c\fR section.
.RE
'
.TP 5
\f(CW=n\fR
Begin the notes section.
'
.TP 5
\f(CW=e\fR
Begin the examples section.
'
.TP 5
\f(CW=h\fR \fIhandlername\fP \fItype\fP
Begin a handler description. Use this section to describe any special
handlers that the element installs. \fIHandlername\fP should be the name of
the handler, and \fItype\fP its type (either `\f(CWread-only\fR',
`\f(CWwrite-only\fR', or `\f(CWread/write\fR'). The following text should
describe that handler. For example:
.nf
   =h capacity read/write
   Returns or sets the queue's capacity.
.fi
'
.TP 5
\f(CW=a\fR [\fItext\fP]
Begin the "see also" section. Use this section to mention other relevant
elements and programs, when appropriate. The more references, the better.
For example:
.nf
   =a RED, FrontDropQueue
.fi
The optional \fItext\fP is just part of the body of the section.
.RS 5
.PP
The references in this section should be either manual page references,
like `\f(CWtcpdump(1)\fR', or text references, like `RFC 959: File Transfer
Protocol'. However, the first paragraph in the section is special. In the
first paragraph, you can just give element names without `\f(CW(n)\fP'
suffixes.
.PP
If one of these references occurs in some other section, it will be
formatted like a link. For example, in
.nf
   =d
   This element is like Queue.
   =a Queue
.fi
the mention of `\f(CWQueue\fR' in the description section will be formatted
like a link.
.RE
'
.TP 5
\f(CW=head1\fR \fIsectionname\fR
Begin a section other than those listed. \fISectionname\fR is the name of
the section.
'
.SS "Other Commands"
.TP 5
\f(CW=head2\fR \fItext\fR
Produce a subheading with \fItext\fR as the text.
.TP 5
\f(CW=over\fR \fIamount\fR
Begin a list of items that is indented by
\fIamount\fR characters. (Some translators may ignore \fIamount\fR.)
.TP 5
\f(CW=item\fR \fItext\fR
Add an item to the latest list opened by \f(CW=over\fR. It is illegal to
use \f(CW=item\fR outside of any \f(CW=over\fR list. The text of the item
is \fItext\fR. If you are creating a bulleted list, use `\f(CW*\fR' as the
text; if you are creating a numbered list, use `\f(CW1.\fR', `\f(CW2.\fR',
and so forth.
.TP 5
\f(CW=back\fR
Close the latest list opened by \f(CW=over\fR.
'
.SH TEXT
Each line that doesn't begin with `\f(CW=\fR' and a lower-case letter is
treated as text. (Unless it starts with a space or tab; see verbatim text,
below.) This text is formatted nicely, and perhaps even justified. You can
use several formatting commands inside normal text; they consist of an
uppercase letter, followed by `\f(CW<\fR', some text, and `\f(CW>\fR'. The
commands are:
.TP 10
\f(CWB<\fItext\f(CW>\fR
Print \fItext\fR in \fBboldface\fR.
.TP 10
\f(CWI<\fItext\f(CW>\fR
Print \fItext\fR in \fIitalic\fR.
.TP 10
\f(CWC<\fItext\f(CW>\fR
Print \fItext\fR like source code, in a constant-width font.
.TP 10
\f(CWF<\fItext\f(CW>\fR
Print \fItext\fR like a filename. By default, filenames appear in italics.
.TP 10
\f(CWL<\fItext\fR|\fIlink\f(CW>\fR
Print \fItext\fR as a hyperlink with destination \fIlink\fR. This usually
just comes out as \fItext\fR.
.TP 10
\f(CWN<>\fR
Put a line break here.
.TP 10
\f(CWE<\fIname\f(CW>\fR
'
Print the HTML-style entity named \fIname\fR. There are six entities:
\f(CWE<lt>\fR is `<', \f(CWE<gt>\fR is `>', \f(CWE<amp>\fR is `&',
\f(CWE<solid>\fR is `/', \f(CWE<verbar>\fR is `|', and \f(CWE<eq>\fR is
`='. This is useful for typing one of these characters in a context that
would seem like a command or formatting command.
'
.SH VERBATIM TEXT
Lines that start with a space or tab character are printed out
verbatim\*Ethat is, without any changes, and with the line breaks and
indentation you specified. You can't use formatting commands
in verbatim text. Verbatim text is useful for showing example code; for
example:
.PP
.nf
  This code
     q :: Queue;
     ... -> RED(5, 50, 0.02) -> q -> ...
  adds RED dropping to q.
.fi
'
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
/* =c
 * Align(MODULUS, OFFSET)
 * =d
 * Aligns packet data. Each input packet is aligned so that
 * its first byte is OFFSET bytes off from a MODULUS-byte
 * boundary. This may involve a packet copy.
 *
 * MODULUS I<must> be 2, 4, or 8.
 * =n
 * The click-align(1) tool will insert this element 
 * automatically wherever it is required.
 * =e
 *   ... -> Align(4, 0) -> ...
 * =a AlignmentInfo, click-align(1) */
