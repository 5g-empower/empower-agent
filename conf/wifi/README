If you want to use the scripts and configurations in this directory,
you probably want to add it to your ${PATH} variable so the 
scripts work.

I usually run the following to associate with an access point:

sudo click station.click > /tmp/station.log
scan.pl
associate.pl


scan.pl will scan all the channels for access points. You can see them
by running

read_handler.pl bs.scan

associate.pl associates with access point with the highest RSSI.
If you run associate.pl "ssid", it will associate with that access 
point.

At this point, you can run dhclient or whatever on the "station"
interface.

You can also run
sudo click dump.click
which will be like running tcpdump with prism headers.
The cool thing is that you can run this while still associated to the 
access point.
You can also change that file to filter out things (like beacons).
