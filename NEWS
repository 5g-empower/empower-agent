Click NEWS

Version 1.0.3

* Added `--reverse' option to click-xform. Suggested by Mike Burrows
  (Compaq SRC).

* Added `--reverse' options to click-fastclassifier and click-devirtualize.

* Renamed click-specialize tool to click-devirtualize. It's clearer. Also
  fixed several bugs.

* Removed `default_processing()' method of Element and replaced it with
  `processing()'. Where you once wrote `Processing default_processing()
  const { return PUSH; }', now write `const char *processing() const {
  return PUSH; }'. The new way is more flexible and lets us abstract the
  element's processing code. See Element(3) for details.


Version 1.0.2   20.Mar.2000

* Fixed reentrancy bug: in this release, when running in polling mode in
  kernel, timers are maintained by click, in the same fashion userlevel timers
  are maintained. Previously, we use linux timers, and so callbacks may get
  called by linux when click is running, creating possible race conditions.
  Note: in polling mode, if the click thread yields to other processes, timers
  will not get called until the click thread runs again.

* Added Rewriter, MappingCreator, and IPMirror elements for rewriting
  TCP/IP and UDP/IP streams.

* Added MarkIPHeader, CheckTCPHeader, and CheckUDPHeader elements.

* Fixed FromDump and ToDump.

* Added optional queue names to RED.

* Removed `is_a()' and `is_a_cast()' methods of Element. The new way,
  `cast()', allows arbitrary interfaces.

* Use Linux's fast checksum routines in CheckIPHeader and IPInputCombo.

* Fixed bug in userlevel Click: elements weren't being scheduled, so
  nothing seemed to happen.


Version 1.0.1   28.Feb.2000

* Fixed Makefile bugs; Linux module installs properly now. Problem reported
  by Joe Elliott <joe@inetd.com>.


Version 1.0   25.Feb.2000

* Added polling support. Result: 4-5 times better peak performance. The
  optimization tools can get it up to 6 times better (435,000 64-byte
  packets per second).

* Replaced work list with stride scheduler.

* In the Linux kernel, Click now runs in a kernel thread.

* Removed packet-upstream events and the associated processing in Queue,
  Shaper, and so forth. The stride scheduler solves the same problem more
  elegantly.

* Added `click-specialize' tool.

* Added `click-uninstall' tool.

* Added dynamic IP routing table element (LookupIPRoute2).

* Added stride scheduling packet scheduler element (StrideSched).

* Added PeekHandlers and PokeHandlers elements so you can test read and
  write handlers at user level.

* Fixed lexer bug: compound elements with `{' are accepted everywhere.

* Added arguments to compound elements.

* Rearranged directory structure. (Include files placed in
  PREFIX/include/click, not directly in PREFIX/include.)

* Improved several elements, including ARPQuerier.

* Changed interface for registering handlers. See
  `elements/standard/red.cc' or the Element.3 manual page for examples.

* Many other changes, bug fixes and improvements.


Version 0.6   11.Dec.1999

* Added dynamic linking support. Click configuration files can now be ar(1)
  archives, possibly containing "packages"---dynamically linked object
  files that are loaded into the kernel module or the user-level program.
  This means you can make your own element classes and link them
  dynamically.

* Added `click-fastclassifier' and `click-install' tools.

* Added `--help', `--version', etc. options to tools.

* Added man pages for `click', `click-align', and `click-install'.

* More options for user-level Click, including support for hander
  invocations on the command line.

* Added `udpgen' and `udpcount' in the `tools' directory.

* Fixed dynamic reconfiguration bug: no more doubled characters.

* Fixed compound element bug: input and output ports bigger than 0 were
  ignored.


Version 0.51   12.Nov.1999

* Support for required-alignment machines via `click-align' tool. Added
  click-align tool, Align and AlignmentInfo elements.

* More documentation.


Version 0.5   20.Oct.1999

* First public release.
