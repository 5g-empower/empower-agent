Version 1.0.5

* Kernel and user-level drivers

** You can hot-swap install Click configurations in the Linux kernel
   module. In a hot-swap install, packets stored in the old configuration
   will not be lost. (The new configuration's Queues must have the same
   names as the old configuration's Queues.) See the click.o(8) man page
   (under /proc/click/hotconfig) and the click-install(1) man page for more
   information.

** Bug fixes: User-level Click correctly handles timed elements like
   TimedSource and TimedSink and scheduled elements like RatedSource; and
   the kernel module correctly handles timed elements. Reported by Saurabh
   Sandhir <sandhir@purdue.edu>.

** More changes to ToDevice to enable Linux and Click to send packets
   independently and not cause race conditions. This includes a new linux
   kernel patch (etc/linux-2.2.14-patch) and changes to ToDevice. Click
   runs in a separate kernel thread, so we synchronize ToDevice send
   operations in kernel with a bit lock (dev->tbusy).

** Every Linux kernel module now runs as a separate kernel thread, even if
   HAVE_POLLING is not defined.

** The click user-level driver can now automatically compile any required
   package sources. (Click-install has been able to do this for a while.)

** Every router has its own list of Timers. Originally requested by Leigh
   Stoller <stoller@fast.cs.utah.edu>. This changed the Timer abstraction;
   you now need to call Timer::attach() on a Timer before using it. See
   timedsource.cc for an example.

** Fixed bugs and memory leaks.

* Tools

** click-xform: Bug fixes and performance improvements. Also, click-xform
   tries to preserve element names from the original configuration. If a
   pattern element and a replacement element share a name, then when the
   pattern is applied, the replacing element will use the name of the
   original element that corresponded to the pattern element. (Phew!)

** click-devirtualize: Bug fixes. It also uses standards-compliant C++.

** click-fastclassifier can combine adjacent Classifiers.

** Added click-combine and click-uncombine.

* Elements

** Removed UnlimitedElement in favor of `notify_n{in,out}puts()'.

** Removed TimedElement.

** Removed Broadcast in favor of Tee.

** Added select_fd() and selected() to ToBPF.

** Various other fixes.

* Configurations

** Added conf/make-udpgen.pl, a Perl script that generates a udpgen-like
   Click configuration.

** Added conf/make-udpcount.pl, a Perl script that generates a
   udpcount-like Click configuration.


Version 1.0.4   13.Apr.2000

* Changed how FromDevice, ToDevice, and PollDevice interact with each
  other. Before, if you specify just PollDevice w/o ToDevice, the tx queue
  does not get cleaned because in polling mode tx queue cleaning must be
  scheduled explicitly. Now, PollDevice looks for a ToDevice on the same
  device. If no such element exists, it remembers to clean the tx queue
  itself. Also ToDevice looks for a PollDevice to decide if it should use
  polling extensions. Some of this code was in the 1.0.3 release, but there
  was a bug.

* New linux kernel patch (etc/linux-2.2.14-patch): locks are added to protect
  recycling of sk_buff objects and device polling functions - not extensively
  tested.

* New elements: UDPEncap (put an UDP header on a packet), RatedSource (like
  infinite source, but send packets at a given rate).

* udpgen click configuration (conf/udpgen.click): This is better than
  udpgen.o in that you can utilize device driver polling extensions. Also,
  on some machines we observe a delay (on order of ms) between when
  transmission complete and tx interrupt. This causes the transmission
  queue to not get cleaned fast enough for udpgen to send its packets.
  Using Click, we can control when the tx queue is cleaned.


Version 1.0.3   9.Apr.2000

* Added `--with-linux[=DIR]' option to `./configure'. Suggested by Richard
  Mortier <Richard.Mortier@cl.cam.ac.uk>.

* Removed `default_processing()' method of Element and replaced it with
  `processing()'. Where you once wrote `Processing default_processing()
  const { return PUSH; }', now write `const char *processing() const {
  return PUSH; }'. The new way is more flexible and lets us abstract the
  element's processing code. See Element(3) for details.

* Added `click-check' tool, a static checker for Click configurations.
  Currently it only checks push and pull processing for correctness.

* Added `--reverse' option to click-xform. Suggested by Mike Burrows
  (Compaq SRC).

* Added `--reverse' options to click-fastclassifier and click-devirtualize.

* Renamed click-specialize tool to click-devirtualize. It's clearer. Also
  fixed several bugs.

* Click-devirtualize now determines automatically whether two specialized
  elements can share code. As a result, the `--like' option has been
  removed.

* Fixed bugs: RFC2507Decomp didn't compile. Rewriter updates. Several bugs
  caught by recent GCCs; patches supplied by Richard Mortier
  <Richard.Mortier@cl.cam.ac.uk>.


Version 1.0.2   20.Mar.2000

* Fixed reentrancy bug: in this release, when running in polling mode in
  kernel, timers are maintained by click, in the same fashion userlevel timers
  are maintained. Previously, we use linux timers, and so callbacks may get
  called by linux when click is running, creating possible race conditions.
  Note: in polling mode, if the click thread yields to other processes, timers
  will not get called until the click thread runs again.

* Added Rewriter, MappingCreator, and IPMirror elements for rewriting
  TCP/IP and UDP/IP streams.

* Added MarkIPHeader, CheckTCPHeader, and CheckUDPHeader elements.

* Fixed FromDump and ToDump.

* Added optional queue names to RED.

* Removed `is_a()' and `is_a_cast()' methods of Element. The new way,
  `cast()', allows arbitrary interfaces.

* Use Linux's fast checksum routines in CheckIPHeader and IPInputCombo.

* Fixed bug in userlevel Click: elements weren't being scheduled, so
  nothing seemed to happen.


Version 1.0.1   28.Feb.2000

* Fixed Makefile bugs; Linux module installs properly now. Problem reported
  by Joe Elliott <joe@inetd.com>.


Version 1.0   25.Feb.2000

* Added polling support. Result: 4-5 times better peak performance. The
  optimization tools can get it up to 6 times better (435,000 64-byte
  packets per second).

* Replaced work list with stride scheduler.

* In the Linux kernel, Click now runs in a kernel thread.

* Removed packet-upstream events and the associated processing in Queue,
  Shaper, and so forth. The stride scheduler solves the same problem more
  elegantly.

* Added `click-specialize' tool.

* Added `click-uninstall' tool.

* Added dynamic IP routing table element (LookupIPRoute2).

* Added stride scheduling packet scheduler element (StrideSched).

* Added PeekHandlers and PokeHandlers elements so you can test read and
  write handlers at user level.

* Fixed lexer bug: compound elements with `{' are accepted everywhere.

* Added arguments to compound elements.

* Rearranged directory structure. (Include files placed in
  PREFIX/include/click, not directly in PREFIX/include.)

* Improved several elements, including ARPQuerier.

* Changed interface for registering handlers. See
  `elements/standard/red.cc' or the Element(3) manual page for examples.

* Many other changes, bug fixes and improvements.


Version 0.6   11.Dec.1999

* Added dynamic linking support. Click configuration files can now be ar(1)
  archives, possibly containing "packages"---dynamically linked object
  files that are loaded into the kernel module or the user-level program.
  This means you can make your own element classes and link them
  dynamically.

* Added `click-fastclassifier' and `click-install' tools.

* Added `--help', `--version', etc. options to tools.

* Added man pages for `click', `click-align', and `click-install'.

* More options for user-level Click, including support for hander
  invocations on the command line.

* Added `udpgen' and `udpcount' in the `tools' directory.

* Fixed dynamic reconfiguration bug: no more doubled characters.

* Fixed compound element bug: input and output ports bigger than 0 were
  ignored.


Version 0.51   12.Nov.1999

* Support for required-alignment machines via `click-align' tool. Added
  click-align tool, Align and AlignmentInfo elements.

* More documentation.


Version 0.5   20.Oct.1999

* First public release.
