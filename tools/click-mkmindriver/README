this set of tools allow you to compile an userlevel click executable that
includes only the elements used by a router configuration file. to make this
happen, you first need to

  1. have a click src directory. for now, assume it is ~/click
  2. build userlevel click in ~/click
  3. run gmake install in ~/click

if you have a configuration file called ~/click/conf/test.conf, you can create
a build environment for that configuration file by doing the following:

  1. cd ~/click/tools/click-shrink
  2. ./setup ~/click tiny ~/click/conf/test.conf

this last step will create a build environment for you in ~/click/tiny.  the
Makefile in that directory will parse ~/click/conf/test.conf and create the
appropriate executable. 

the second argument to setup must be a relative path from ~/click. the
executable created will only run ~/click/conf/test.conf, or other
configuration files that use elements or a subset of the elements in
test.conf.
