CLICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===============================

The user-level version of Click should compile and run on Intel x86 systems
running Unix, using the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) system to communicate
with the network. The Linux kernel module requires a patched Linux 2.2
system (we've tested on recent Linux kernels like 2.2.10 and 2.2.11).

First, run

	./configure

This will test your system and decide the versions that will work for you
(user-level, Linux module, or both). To compile Click at user level, you
must have the pcap library on your system.

Un-tar the Click source and remember where you put it:

  tar xf click.tar
  cd click
  set d=`pwd`

You can compile the userlevel version of Click right away:

  cd $d
  ./configure
  cd userlevel
  gmake

Before you can compile or use the Click loadable kernel module, you
need to install, patch, compile, and boot a compatible Linux kernel.
Start by making sure you have a copy of Linux 2.2.X sources in (or
symbolically linked to by) /usr/src/linux. If you need to fetch source
from www.kernel.org, make sure it's the version of 2.2.X reported by
uname -r.

Install the Click Linux kernel patch:

  cd /usr/src/linux
  patch -p0 -b < $d/patch-2.2

Configure and compile the kernel:

  cd /usr/src/linux
  make menuconfig
  make dep
  make bzImage
make install? so EXTRAVERSION?

Boot the new kernel.

Compile the Click kernel module:

  cd $d
  ./configure
  cd linuxmodule
  gmake

Install the module:

  /sbin/insmod $d/linuxmodule/click.o
