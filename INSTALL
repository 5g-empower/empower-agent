CLICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===============================

To compile any version of Click, you will need the GNU C compiler; the GNU
C++ compiler (version 2.8 or above, or a recent version of egcs); and GNU
Make. (You may have luck with other C++ compilers if you change the
Makefiles. There is no GNU-specific code, only GNU-specific compiler
options.)

The user-level version of Click should compile and run on any Intel x86
Unix systems that have the pcap library. (The pcap library is necessary to
communicate with the network.) The Linux kernel module requires a patched
Linux 2.2 system; we've tested on recent Linux kernels like 2.2.10 and
2.2.11.

First, run

	./configure

This will test your system and decide the versions that will work for you
(user-level, Linux module, or both). It will tell you what is wrong if it
cannot compile a version.

USERLEVEL
---------

The configure script may not be able to find your pcap library if it's in a
nonstandard place. To fix this, set your `PCAP_HEADER_PATH' and
`PCAP_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variables and rerun `./configure'. The
`PCAP_HEADER_PATH' variable is for options that tell the C preprocessor
where to find `pcap.h'; the `PCAP_LIBRARY_PATH' variable is for options
that tell the linker where to find `libpcap.a'. One example setting would
be `PCAP_HEADER_PATH=-I/usr/local/include/pcap' and
`PCAP_LIBRARY_PATH=-L/usr/local/lib/pcap'.

LINUX MODULE
------------

Before you can compile or use the Click loadable kernel module, you
need to install, patch, compile, and boot a compatible Linux kernel.
Start by making sure you have a copy of Linux 2.2.X sources in (or
symbolically linked to by) /usr/src/linux. If you need to fetch source
from www.kernel.org, make sure it's the version of 2.2.X reported by
uname -r.

Install the Click Linux kernel patch:

  cd /usr/src/linux
  patch -p0 -b < $d/patch-2.2

Configure and compile the kernel:

  cd /usr/src/linux
  make menuconfig
  make dep
  make bzImage
make install? so EXTRAVERSION?

Boot the new kernel.

Compile the Click kernel module:

  cd $d
  ./configure
  cd linuxmodule
  gmake

Install the module:

  /sbin/insmod $d/linuxmodule/click.o
