These elements do not support IPsec fully. The stuff that are missing are:

  - anti-reply attack detection during ESP unencapsulation process
  - on DES decryption, does not deal with packet reordering right now
  - to use IPsec, you would need to hook up a Classifier to statically
    configure a SAD. we need a better way to do this!

Are you interested in reviving IPsec support yourself, or is IPsec important
for you? If so, please contact the Click team via email:
