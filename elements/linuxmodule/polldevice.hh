PollDevice(DEVNAME [, PROMISC, BURST, I<KEYWORDS>])

=s devices

polls packets from network device (kernel)

=d

Poll packets received by the Linux network interface named DEVNAME. Packets
will be pushed to output 0. The packets include the link-level header. DEVNAME
may also be an Ethernet address, in which case PollDevice searches for a
device with that address.

Each time PollDevice is scheduled, it emits at most BURST packets. By default,
BURST is 8.

If PROMISC is set (by default, it is not), then the device is put into
promiscuous mode.

This element is only available in the Linux kernel module.

Keyword arguments are:

=over 8

=item PROMISC

Boolean. Same as the PROMISC argument.

=item BURST

Unsigned integer. Same as the BURST argument.

=item ALLOW_NONEXISTENT

Allow nonexistent devices. If true, and no device named DEVNAME exists when
the router is initialized, then PollDevice will report a warning (rather than
an error). Later, while the router is running, if a device named DEVNAME
appears, PollDevice will seamlessly begin emitting its packets. Default is
false.

=back

=n

Linux won't see any packets from the device. If you want Linux to process
packets, you should hand them to ToHost. Also, if you would like to send
packets while using PollDevice, you should also define a ToDevice on the same
device.

This element can only be used with devices that support the Click polling
extension. We have written polling patches for the Tulip Ethernet driver.

=h packets read-only

Returns the number of packets ToDevice has pulled.

=h reset_counts write-only

Resets C<packets> counter to zero when written.
