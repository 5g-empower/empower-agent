FromDevice(DEVNAME [, PROMISC, BURST, I<KEYWORDS>])

=s devices

reads packets from network device (kernel)

=d

This manual page describes the Linux kernel module version of the FromDevice
element. For the user-level element, read the FromDevice.u manual page.

Intercepts all packets received by the Linux network interface named DEVNAME
and pushes them out output 0. The packets include the link-level header.
DEVNAME may also be an Ethernet address, in which case FromDevice searches for
a device with that address.

FromDevice receives packets at interrupt time. As this happens, FromDevice
simply stores the packets in an internal queue. Later, in the Click kernel
thread -- that is, not at interrupt time -- FromDevice emits packets from that
queue as it is scheduled by the driver. It emits at most BURST packets per
scheduling; BURST is 8 by default.

If PROMISC is set (by default, it is not), then the device is put into
promiscuous mode while FromDevice is active.

Keyword arguments are:

=over 8

=item PROMISC

Boolean. Same as the PROMISC argument.

=item BURST

Unsigned integer. Same as the BURST argument.

=item ALLOW_NONEXISTENT

Allow nonexistent devices. If true, and no device named DEVNAME exists when
the router is initialized, then FromDevice will report a warning (rather than
an error). Later, while the router is running, if a device named DEVNAME
appears, FromDevice will seamlessly begin outputing its packets. Default is
false.

=back

=n

Linux won't see any packets from the device. If you want Linux to process
packets, you should hand them to ToHost.

FromDevice accesses packets the same way Linux does: through interrupts.
This is bad for performance. If you care about performance and have a
polling-capable device, use PollDevice instead.
