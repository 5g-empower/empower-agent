1. Introduction

This is the README file for the Click source distribution of October
19 1999. Look for more recent information at

Click is a modular router tool kit. To use it you'll need to know how
to compile and install the software, how to write router
configurations, and how to write new elements.

2. Installation

Read and obey the INSTALL file.

3. Configuration

Click has a configuration language you must use to tell it how to
process packets. The language describes a graph of "elements," or
packet processing modules. doc/click.5 describes the language.  The
best introduction to the architecture as a whole is

3.2 Configuring Kernel-Module Click

Once you've compiled in the linuxmodule subdirectory, install
the resulting kernel module with

  /sbin/insmod linuxmodule/click.o

As a result the directory /proc/click should appear. Configure the
kernel module by writing a configuration file to /proc/click/config;
for example,

  cat configuration-file /proc/click/config

If any errors occured, they will apper in /proc/click/errors.

If you wish to remove the Click software from the kernel, and thus
revert to Linux's ordinary network stack, run

  /sbin/rmmod click

It's easy to create configurations which break Linux's network
support.
