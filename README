THE CLICK MODULAR ROUTER RELEASE 0.5
====================================

    This is the README file for a preliminary, pre-beta Click source
distribution of October 19, 1999. The first thing you should do is look for
more recent information on the Web at

	http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/click/

    Click is a modular router toolkit. To use it you'll need to know how to
compile and install the software, how to write router configurations, and
how to write new elements. Our SOSP 1999 paper (available from the Web
site) is a good place to get a feeling for what Click can do.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

    The `INSTALL' file in this directory contains installation
instructions. User documentation is in the `doc' subdirectory. This
directory contains manual pages for the Click language, the Linux kernel
module, and the `click-xform' configuration optimizer; it also has a script
that generates manual pages for many of the elements distributed in this
package. To install these manual pages so you can read them, follow the
`INSTALL' instructions, but `make install-man' instead of `make install'.

RUNNING A CLICK ROUTER
----------------------

    Before playing with a Click router, you should get familiar with the
Click configuration language. You use this to tell Click how to process
packets. The language describes a graph of "elements," or packet processing
modules. See the `doc/click.5' manual page for a detailed description, or
check the `conf' directory for some simple examples.

    Click can be compiled as a user-level program, which (when run as the
superuser) can get copies of arriving packets via the pcap library, or as a
Linux kernel module, which lives in the kernel and steals packets directly
from devices.

User-Level Program
------------------

    Run the user-level program by giving it the name of a configuration
file: `click CONFIGFILE'. If you have compiled Click with pcap support,
you'll want to use the FromBPF, ToBPF, FromDump, and ToDump elements. You
can still play around with Click even without pcap support: check out the
InfiniteSource and TimedSource elements, or write your own
packet-generation element.

Linux Kernel Module
-------------------

    See the `doc/click.o.8' manual page for a detailed description. To
summarize, install the module with `insmod PATH/click.o'; then initialize
it with a configuration with `cat CONFIGFILE > /proc/click/config'. If any
errors occured, they will appear in `/proc/click/errors'.

Configurations
--------------

    A few configurations are included in the `conf' directory, including a
Perl script that generated the IP router configurations used in our SOSP
paper (`conf/make-ip-conf.pl') and a set of patterns for the Click
optimizer (`conf/ip.clickpat'). The configurations are presently un- or
under-documented. Please check back to our Web site for more up-to-date
configurations.
