THE CLICK MODULAR ROUTER RELEASE 1.1
====================================

    This is the README file for the source release for the Click modular
software router. The first thing you should do is look for more recent
information on the Web at

	http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/click/

    Click is a modular router toolkit. To use it you'll need to know how to
compile and install the software, how to write router configurations, and
how to write new elements. Our ACM Transactions on Computer Systems paper
(available from the Web site) will give you a feeling for what Click can
do. (Note: Using the optimization tools under CLICKDIR/tools, you can get
even better performance than that paper describes.)

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

    The `INSTALL' file in this directory contains installation
instructions. User documentation is in the `doc' subdirectory. This
directory contains manual pages for the Click language, the Linux kernel
module, and several tools; it also has a script that generates manual pages
for many of the elements distributed in this package. To install these
manual pages so you can read them, follow the `INSTALL' instructions, but
`make install-man' instead of `make install'.

RUNNING A CLICK ROUTER
----------------------

    Before playing with a Click router, you should get familiar with the
Click configuration language. You use this to tell Click how to process
packets. The language describes a graph of "elements", or packet processing
modules. See the `doc/click.5' manual page for a detailed description, or
check the `conf' directory for some simple examples.

    Click can be compiled as a user-level program, which (when run as the
superuser) can get copies of arriving packets via the pcap library; or as a
Linux kernel module, which lives in the kernel and steals packets directly
from devices.

User-Level Program
------------------

    Run the user-level program by giving it the name of a configuration
file: `click CONFIGFILE'. If you have compiled Click with pcap support,
you'll want to use the FromDevice, ToDevice, FromDump, and ToDump elements.
You can still play around with Click even without pcap support: check out
the InfiniteSource and TimedSource elements, or write your own
packet-generation element.

Linux Kernel Module
-------------------

    See the `doc/click.o.8' manual page for a detailed description. To
summarize, install a configuration by running `click-install CONFIGFILE'.
This will also install the kernel module if necessary and report any errors
to standard error. (You must run `make install' before `click-install' will
work.)

    You can also install the kernel module with `/sbin/insmod click.o', and
then install a configuration by hand with `cat CONFIGFILE >
/proc/click/config'. If any errors occurred, they will appear in
`/proc/click/errors'. But `click-install' is easier.

Configurations
--------------

    A few configurations are included in the `conf' directory, including a
Perl script that generated the IP router configurations used in our TOCS
paper (`conf/make-ip-conf.pl') and a set of patterns for the Click pattern
optimizer, click-xform (`conf/ip.clickpat'). The configurations are
presently un- or under-documented. Please check back to our Web site for
more up-to-date configurations.
